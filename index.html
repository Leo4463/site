An explanation of F1

<h4>
F1 is an incredibly complicated sport consisting of 10 teams each with two driver which makes up 20 drivers on the grid all racing it to the line to finish first and score maximum points. But only one driver can be spraying the champagne on the top step which is what makes the sport as intense as it is.

Now we have to get to the teams and drivers. I'll be ranking them from best of their era to the young hotshots with talents just waiting to be unleashed.
1. Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes.<br>

Lewis is a veteran. Being one of the VERY few drivers to compete for the championship in their rookie season, his in 2007. He lost this championship by a mistake in the Chinese Grand Prix which ruined his chance and ended up being 1 point off the championship victory. This was just in his rookie season. He was one if not the only driver to be signed with a top team in his rookie season because of his huge sucsess in his junior career. Lewis Hamilton later equaled the 7 championship world record in 2020 and in the present has the most victories, pole positions and fastest laps of any driver. I would consider him the best of the sport and it would be shameful not to include him in this list. Hes getting older for F1, but we do have a driver in our 40s, so lets hope he can stay for long.
